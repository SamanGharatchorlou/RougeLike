The download file includes an image (quick_guide.png) that shows a simple overview of the icon arrangement.

------------------------- COLORS

The icon set comes in two different color variations: 

The first is the "full color", which is the normal version best for general use.
It doesn't use a specific overall color palette.

The "limited color" version matches the muted colors of the Time Fantasy assets.
The icons in this set will match visually with all of my graphics in the TF style.

------------------------- FORMATS

This set includes multiple formats for use in different game engines.

The larger full sheets are arranged in a format that can be used in RPG Maker.
The 32x32 format will work in RPG Maker VX/Ace, and the 24x24 format will work in RPG Maker MV.

The large sheets should also be compatible with most other engines and software. Also included
are individual images for each icon, if that is more useful for you.

-------------------------

This tileset pack was created over the past two years to expand on the small icon set 
that was initially released as a bonus inclusion with my "Farm and Fort" tilset pack. 
Over time, this set of icons just kept getting bigger and bigger, until we reached the 
1000+ icons that make up this final release.

Many of the icons in this collection were created to fill requests for suggestions from
my patrons. This set wouldn't be possible without the support from patrons-- not just
the money backing which has allowed me to work on these graphics, but also the 
creative input and ideas from my patron community.
