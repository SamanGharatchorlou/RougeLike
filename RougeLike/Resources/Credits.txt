CODE CREDITS

- XML Parsing code -
To read xml files I used 'RapidXml' from http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/
The author of RapidXml is Marcin Kalicinski


- Memory Tracking code -
For debuging and tracking memory I used 'MemTrack: Tracking Memory Allocations in C++'
http://www.almostinfinite.com/memtrack.html

All other code in this game other than what's mentioned above was written by me (Saman Gharatchorlou) in C++ on Visual Studio using the SDL2 library. https://www.libsdl.org/.
