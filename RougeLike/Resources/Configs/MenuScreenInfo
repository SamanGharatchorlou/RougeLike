RougeLike UI

All elements need to be within a 'layer' element e.g.

<layer>
	<Element></Element>
</layer>

Layers are rendered in a top first, bottom last order.
Elements are also rendered in the same order within the layer

Possible UI Elements: Element, Box, Button, TextBox

If a parent is specified all positions and sizes are based relative to its parent


Textbox:

Example...

<TextBox id = "Def val" parent = "StatBox" x = "0.75" y = "0.25" height = "0.1" width ="0.5">
	<text font = "lazy.ttf" r = "0" g = "255" b = "0" >0</text>
</TextBox>

The text field auto sizes to whatever the smallest dimention is i.e. width or height

Optional ptSize field can be added to the text field if you dont want to auto size within the dimentions
